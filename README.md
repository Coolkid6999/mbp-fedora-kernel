# mbp-fedora-kernel

Fedora kernel with Apple T2 patches built-in (Macbooks produced >= 2018).

Fedora ISO (with mbp-fedora-kernel builtin) - <https://github.com/mikeeq/mbp-fedora>

There are multiple version of the kernel maintained on seperate branches (all compiled versions could be found in releases section):

- 5.4-f31 - <https://github.com/mikeeq/mbp-fedora-kernel/tree/v5.4-f31>
- 5.3-f31 - <https://github.com/mikeeq/mbp-fedora-kernel/tree/v5.3-f31>
- 5.3-f30 - <https://github.com/mikeeq/mbp-fedora-kernel/tree/v5.3-f30>
- 5.1-f30 - <https://github.com/mikeeq/mbp-fedora-kernel/tree/v5.1>

## TODO

- integrate `roadrunner2/macbook12-spi-driver` and `MCMrARM/mbp2018-bridge-drv` drivers
- add `kernel-headers` rpm generation

> Tested on: Macbook Pro 15,2 13" 2019 i5 TouchBar Z0WQ000AR MV972ZE/A/R1

### Known issues

- 5.2<= kernel random kernel panics - just disable thunderbolt driver

  ```
  âžœ cat /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
  blacklist applesmc
  blacklist thunderbolt
  ```
  - it's working on 5.1, because 5.1 is failing to load thunderbolt firmware
- Microphone (it's recognised with new apple t2 sound driver, but there is a low mic volume amp)
- Dynamic audio outputs change (on connecting/disconnecting headphones jack)
- Suspend/Resume (sleep mode)
- Thunderbolt

#### Working with upstream stable kernel 5.1

- Display/Screen
- USB-C
- Battery/AC
- Ethernet/Video USB-C adapters
- Bluetooth

#### Working with mbp-fedora-kernel

- NVMe
- Camera
- keyboard
- touchpad (scroll, right click)
- wifi
  - you need to manually extract firmware from MacOS

> The firmware files to use can be found by running `ioreg -l | grep C-4364` or `ioreg -l | grep RequestedFiles`, copy from `/usr/share/firmware/wifi` when being on MacOS

```
Put the firmware in the right place!
The .trx file for your model goes to /lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac4364-pcie.bin,
the .clmb goes to /lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac4364-pcie.clm_blob
and the .txt to something like /lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac4364-pcie.Apple Inc.-MacBookPro15,2.txt
```

#### Working with external drivers

>> with @MCMrARM mbp2018-bridge-drv

- keyboard
- touchpad
- touchbar
- audio

#### Not tested

- eGPU
